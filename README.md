## Enigma code ##

This repo contains my attempt to build an example of the enigma machine as seen in WWII in python. 

The enigma machine was a device for encoding messages to be sent over the radio without hostile combatants being able to read your messages. Since it was used by the nazis its a good thing that it was fundamentally flawed. 

Since this encryption scheme is so famous I decided to recreate it in python.
